#**Belly Button Challenge**
##Module 14

This challenge was to reinforce what we learned exploring information using JavaScript. The exercise was to build a dashboard for microbes that colonize human navels and analyze the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). To accomplish this I did the following steps.

1. First load the json data using the d3 function.

1. Create a dropdown function for the dashboard.

1. Build the graphs/charts using codes.

1. Finally call the functions to display the graphs.
